Hello, my name is Raphael Cau and I'm a CS student in Ynov campus Bordeaux in France
It's only my second year in my school, but we are already learning multiple languages like java, javascript, html/css, python and a lot more !
This account is supposed to be my official github for my future, the github that companies will see with my projects.
I have for projects to develop things in JS, some backend and some frontend also using some actual technologies . 
I am going to try to specialize myself in JS for the moment, try some backend and frontend with it.
That's all ! If you took your time to read this thank you.
